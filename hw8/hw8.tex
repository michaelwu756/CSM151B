\section*{Problem 1}

The average number of cycles that a memory access will take is
\[0.94\times 1\text{ cycles} + 0.06\times 55\text{ cycles} = 4.24 \text{ cycles}\]
Each cycle takes \(0.5\) ns, which means that the effective access time is
\[2.12\times 10^{-9} \text{ s}\]

\section*{Problem 2}

The number of sets in the cache would decrease to 128, which would require 7 index bits and 23 tag bits.
Each cache entry has 1 valid bit, 23 tag bits, and 32 data bits, which is 56 bits total. There are \(128\times 8=1024\)
cache entries total which means that the bits of storage required to implement the cache is 57344 bits.
